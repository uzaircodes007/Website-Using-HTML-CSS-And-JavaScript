The 565-hp twin-turbo V6 may be massive in strength, yet it’s highly refined, even earning ULEV-II emissions rating. Rather than traditional cast-iron liners, each cylinder features a unique plasma coating on cylinder walls, with an independent intake system for each bank of cylinders. The powerful twin turbo takes advantage of a Premium Midship (PM) design for balance, where much of the engine sits back in the chassis. Uniquely brilliant, built to perform.</i> </h2> </p> </br> <br> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
