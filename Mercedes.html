<img src="mercedess500.jpg" width="600" height="500"> <br> <h6> <p> <b> New Mercedes-Benz S-Class models aren’t an everyday occurrence, so when they do come along they create a big stir throughout the global automotive industry.

Obviously the designers of Merc’s arch rivals Audi A8 and BMW 7 series will pay the most attention. However, lesser car makers also inspect the S-Class very closely because it signals the way in which technology is advancing, technology that will eventually work its way down into more affordable cars. </b> </p> </h6>

It’s powered by a 6.2-liter V-8 that makes 583 hp, mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. Got cash to burn?
